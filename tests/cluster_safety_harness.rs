//! Item 10: deterministic in-process multi-replica cluster safety harness.
//!
//! A cluster of public-API `Replica`s talks through a controllable bus. The
//! bus supports delivery, drop, duplication, reorder, and a simple
//! split-point partition (cross-partition traffic is withheld until healed,
//! and may be dropped while partitioned). Host execution completions are
//! deterministic functions of the executed entry. All scheduling is seeded
//! (SplitMix64), so every schedule replays bit-identically.
//!
//! Safety invariant, checked after EVERY harness step (every message
//! delivery, every host input, every fault action — never only at the end):
//! committed-slot agreement — no two replicas execute different entries at
//! the same slot. Since a replica executes its log in slot order, this is
//! pairwise equality of the executed log prefixes, plus the per-replica
//! sanity that only committed entries ever execute (`executed <= commit`).
//!
//! Progress is checked in a fair (lossless, immediately completing)
//! schedule for K=3 and K=4; safety is checked under finite seeded
//! loss/reorder/duplicate/partition schedules for K=3 through K=7. K=5 is
//! the smallest size where a recovering replica tolerates a further failure
//! (recovery needs `Q` distinct *other* normal responders, which is every
//! remaining member at K=3 and K=4), so the sizes above 4 are not redundant.
