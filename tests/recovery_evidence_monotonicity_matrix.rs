//! Item 04 verification matrix: same-sender recovery evidence is monotonic.
//!
//! Independent verification of the F02 fix (`Replica::stronger_recovery_response`
//! in `src/vrr.rs`), complementing the item 03 reorder/duplicate regressions in
//! `recovery_evidence_overwrite_regression.rs`. Every fed message is admissible
//! under the core's own recovery admission rules (nonce match, provenance
//! `state.is_some() == (from == leader_of(view))`, `valid_state_message`), so
//! each outcome is decided by the per-sender monotonicity gate alone:
//!
//! - view arm: a delayed older-view response cannot overwrite newer evidence,
//!   even when it carries strictly stronger state content (view dominates);
//! - same-view frontier arm: leader evidence cannot regress slot or commit —
//!   a higher slot with a lower commit is rejected, and an equal frontier with
//!   different content (a tie) never overwrites;
//! - same-view prefix arm: a forked log is rejected even with a strictly
//!   higher slot/commit frontier;
//! - advance arm: older-to-newer same-view evidence is accepted and installed;
//! - duplicate arm: exact same-sender duplicates (state or nonleader) are
//!   idempotent no-ops;
//! - completion arm: a stale response against a quorum-sized but blocked map
//!   produces no output and no mutation (no spurious `finish_recovery`), and
//!   the blocked attempt still completes once newer same-sender evidence
//!   arrives.
