//! Item 06 verification matrix: the explicit `Status::Replaying` phase keeps
//! recovery isolated through committed reconstruction and activates exactly
//! when `executed` reaches `commit`.
//!
//! Independent verification of the foreground F03 fix (`Status::Replaying`,
//! the `in_recovery()` fencing of leader-timeout and view-change paths, and
//! frontier-exact activation in `Replica::complete` / `finish_recovery` in
//! `src/vrr.rs`), complementing the item 05 exposure regression in
//! `recovery_early_activation_regression.rs` and the `Status::Recovering`
//! matrices in `recovery_isolation_completion_matrix.rs`:
//!
//! - local-input arm: every non-completion local input is fenced during the
//!   replay phase (`Recover` restarts the attempt, as during `Recovering`);
//!   `Complete` is the only replay-progress input;
//! - peer-body arm: every peer body — normal-operation, view-change, and
//!   recovery forms — is fenced without mutation while replay is unfinished;
//! - activation arm: only completions matching the in-flight committed slot
//!   advance replay, and activation happens exactly when `executed` reaches
//!   `commit` — never earlier, never later;
//! - zero-commit arm: a quorum installing no unexecuted committed work
//!   activates immediately;
//! - prefix arm: committed reconstruction resumes at the preserved executed
//!   prefix, re-executing nothing already executed;
//! - cache arm: replayed results are cached and reply from cache once the
//!   replica later leads, and subsequent normal-operation prepares work.
