//! Source 01 R1 / F02 regression: recovery evidence must be monotonic per sender.
//!
//! `Replica::receive` stores each admissible `RecoveryResponse` with
//! `self.recovery.insert(from, (epoch, state))` (`src/vrr.rs`), unconditionally
//! replacing any earlier response from the same sender. Under the permitted
//! network model (duplicated and reordered messages — e.g. a duplicated
//! `Recovery` broadcast draws one response from a node before and one after it
//! advances, delivered newest-first) a delayed older same-sender response
//! overwrites newer evidence and quorum completion then installs stale state.
//!
//! The first two tests assert the required monotonic contract and fail on the
//! defective core. The last two are controls (fortunate ordering, exact
//! duplicates) that pass before and after a fix, pinning that the defect is
//! specifically the nonmonotonic overwrite.
