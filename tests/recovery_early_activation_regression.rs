//! Source 01 R3 / F03 regression: recovery must not activate `Status::Normal`
//! before committed replay finishes.
//!
//! `Replica::finish_recovery` (`src/vrr.rs`) installs the recovered state with
//! `adopt`, then runs `activate_view` — status becomes `Normal` — and only
//! afterwards emits the first reconstruction work via `pending_execution`.
//! The replica therefore spends the whole committed-replay window (every
//! `Input::Complete` from the first emitted `Output::Execute` up to the final
//! committed slot) observable as `Normal`, so its `status == Status::Normal`
//! guards admit normal and view-change traffic while the deterministic
//! service state and the cached client results are still incomplete.
//!
//! The first three tests assert the required contract — activation only after
//! the final committed completion, with non-completion traffic fenced during
//! reconstruction — and fail on the defective core. The last is a control
//! (completion inputs drive replay to the committed frontier, after which
//! normal traffic is admitted) that passes before and after a fix, pinning
//! that the defect is premature activation, not the replay mechanism itself.
